## Strategic Pivot Analysis

### What Changed (November 14, 2025)

**Iain's Email Reveals**:
- They're "suggesting strongly that they want to do the scanning"
- This is actually an opportunity, not a problem
- They recognize the value of controlling quality from the source

### Original Assumptions vs New Reality

| Aspect | Original Model | New Model with Scanning |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Scanning | By Cornerstone | By Proaptus |
| Document Quality | Mixed (50% good) | High (85% good) |
| Conflicts | £95,000 budget | £7,500 budget |
| Client Work | 90% of conflicts | Minimal |
| Our Role | AI processor | End-to-end provider |
| Accountability | Shared | Single vendor |

## Our Response Strategy

### Key Messages to Emphasize

#### 1. Value Creation
"By handling scanning, we're not just adding a service - we're transforming the entire value equation"

#### 2. Cost Neutralization
"While scanning adds £175,000, it eliminates £87,500 in conflicts, so net addition is only £87,500"

#### 3. Labor Savings
"This removes £81,000-£90,000 of conflict resolution work from your team"

#### 4. Quality Transformation
"Controlled scanning gives us 85% good quality vs 50% with existing scans"

#### 5. Risk Mitigation
"Single vendor accountability - no coordination overhead or finger-pointing"

### Positioning Framework

**NOT This**: "Scanning will cost an additional £175,000"

**But This**: "For a net increase of only £87,500, you get:
- £81,000 in labor savings
- 95% quality vs 85% without
- Single vendor simplicity
- Guaranteed outcomes"

## Email Response Template

### Suggested Response to Iain

**Subject**: Re: Cornerstone AI Document Reading - Enhanced Proposal with Scanning

Dear Iain,

Thank you for your patience and the excellent questions. After analyzing your requirements, particularly around scanning, we've identified a significant opportunity to deliver even better value.

**Headline: Including Scanning Actually Reduces Your Total Costs**

By having us handle the document scanning:
- Your internal conflict resolution burden drops by 90% (saving £81,000-£90,000 in labor)
- Document quality increases to 85% (from 50% assumed)
- You get single vendor accountability
- Total net cost increase is only £87,500 for dramatically better outcomes

**Revised Pricing (17,000 sites)**:
- **CAPEX**: £442,500 (includes scanning, quality control, and all setup)
- **OPEX**: £3,500/month (reduced from £5,000 due to better quality)

**Your Specific Questions**:
1. ✅ Yes, CTIL hosting confirmed
2. ✅ Scanning: £175,000 for 17,000 sites (but saves you £87,500 in conflicts)
3. ✅ Yes, we manage the complete scanning process
4. ✅ Yes, your standard questions are included in setup
5. ✅ Siterra integration via standard APIs (included)
6. ✅ Ongoing maintenance at £3,500/month covers new sites

**Why This Is Better**:
- Eliminates 2-3 FTEs worth of work from your team
- Reduces project risk with single accountability
- Accelerates deployment by 2 months
- Creates a scalable foundation for future growth

**Next Steps**:
1. Review the attached detailed proposal
2. Consider a 1,000-site pilot to validate the approach
3. Schedule a call to discuss implementation timeline

We're confident this enhanced approach delivers the best possible outcome for Cornerstone.

Best regards,
Chinedu

## Key Negotiation Points

### If They Push Back on Scanning Cost

**Response Options**:

1. **Emphasize Net Cost**:
   "The net increase is only £87,500 when we factor in conflict reduction"

2. **Highlight Their Savings**:
   "Your team saves £81,000-£90,000 in labor - this pays for itself"

3. **Quality Argument**:
   "85% quality vs 50% means fewer issues throughout the project lifecycle"

4. **Risk Reduction**:
   "Single vendor accountability is worth the investment alone"

5. **Pilot Option**:
   "Let's prove it with 1,000 sites first"

### If They Want Scanning Separately Priced

**Positioning**:
- Show as separate line item but emphasize total value
- Create "Bundle A" (without) vs "Bundle B" (with) comparison
- Make Bundle B obviously superior value

### If They Question Our Scanning Capability

**Evidence Points**:
- AI-optimized scanning protocols
- Quality metrics from similar projects
- Technology stack and expertise
- Partnership options with scanning specialists

## Documentation for Q&A Agent

### Critical Context Points

1. **17,000 sites is non-negotiable baseline**
   - Don't suggest reducing scope
   - This is their firm requirement

2. **Scanning inclusion is strategic**
   - Not just an add-on service
   - Transforms entire value proposition
   - Client actually wants this

3. **Financial math is compelling**
   - £175k scanning - £87.5k conflict savings = £87.5k net
   - Client saves additional £81-90k in labor
   - Monthly OPEX reduces by £1,500

4. **Quality improvement cascades**
   - 85% good quality (vs 50%)
   - 3-5% review rate (vs 15%)
   - 2 min conflicts/site (vs 18 min)
   - 95% accuracy (vs 85%)

5. **Competitive positioning**
   - Only end-to-end provider
   - 80% cheaper than manual
   - 50% cheaper than competitors
   - Single accountability

### Common Q&A Scenarios

**Q: Why wasn't scanning in the original proposal?**
A: Client initially indicated they would handle scanning. Their November email shows they now prefer us to handle it for quality control.

**Q: Is the price increase justified?**
A: Net increase is only £87,500 after conflict savings, and client saves £81,000-£90,000 in labor, making it cash-positive for them.

**Q: Can we do without scanning?**
A: Yes, but quality suffers (50% vs 85% good), conflicts increase 10x, and client bears heavy burden.

**Q: What if scanning costs overrun?**
A: Our £175,000 quote includes 20% contingency. Pilot program validates costs before full rollout.
